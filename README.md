# TaskManager
Time and Task Management Tool

## Basic Features
- Tasks: Ability to create a list of tasks to do with option to add deadlines 
  - Tasks can have different priorities where it can automatically increase in priority (or stay the same) as the deadline approaches
  - Perhaps estimated amount of time needed to do task?
- Schedule: Ability to block out times where one is unavailible to do tasks, like a calendar except with the added "hard block of time set or soft" hard and soft meaning whether one can do other stuff during this block of time. Ex: work is a hard block of time because you have to go to work in that set time frame and cannot do other things during work hours, whereas sleep is a softer block of time since you can choose to sleep a little later or wake a little earlier. Can be implemented using priority??? So maybe these can also be tasks.
- Potentially as deadlines approach, can be reminded about deadline task, as well as warned when you may not have time to do the task due to preexiting schedule. Ex. You have a task to do essay in the next week with estimated time needed of 6 hrs, but you only have 5 hrs of unblocked time, it warns you. 
- Potentially gamify accomplishing tasks????
